* thaal-vetti
UI tool for splitting scanned two page pdf 

** Usage
The tool consists for two scripts for now. `vetti.sh` and `vetti.py`.

`vetti.sh` is the main interface. 

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
vetti.sh csm <path-to-pdf>
#+END_SRC

where, csm - chunk, split, merge

say the pdf filename is tamil.pdf,

- chunk - splits the pdf into images (one per page) and places it under the tamil.pdf_pages/ directory
- split - take images from tamil.pdf_pages and shows you a GUI for drawing a line,
 where to slice the image and place them under tamil.pdf_split_pages/ directory
- merge - will collect all the images from tamil.pdf_split_pages/ directory and produce a pdf file


*** Note
- it is preferred that for every pdf you run this tool once and finish it off in single stroke
- but they can be independently run, but note that merge task will delete all the files created by chunk and merge

For example, in case the pdf is already chunked into pages, you can just run,
#+BEGIN_SRC 
vetti.sh sm <path-to-pdf>
#+END_SRC
