* Add support to tag single pages
** Just leave the single pages alone. 
- need to add new tagging field
- change process() to make use of the flag

* remove all the extra features
- like flipping, rotating 
- they mostly confuse (even me at time)

* Edit README
** add instruction as to how to run the program
** a minimal documentation
